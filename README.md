# Web3 Education: Decentralized Certificate Issuer
Decentralized Certificate Issuer for web3 education certifications project submitted for the SpaghettETH Hackathon

Development of a protocol to issue education certificates approved by a Decentralized Certificate Issuer in a form of a DAO, to extend and improve the currently existing standard for course certificates.

This will enable learners to create their own educational portfolio in which they can add Proof of Attendance to events, conferences, workshops and trainings. 

The protocol is structured to allow easy integration with third parties and service providers to display user portfolios and certification in their applications without relying on centralized APIs.

The governance is structured to attract highly valuable professionals in the approval of projects, certificate submissions and events.
